    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello, I am Niharika Prabhu, and my favorite color is orange! I am an aspiring astronomer, and although it's a reach, I hope to go to CalTech for college. I am slowly trying to learn more about computer science, hence why I took this class. My biggest interest are indian movies, such as Bollywood, Tollywood, and Kollywood. However, I also like the Mission Impossible and James Bond series, and the TV shows Sonic Boom and Inspector Gadget 2015. I also like to overshare. Sorry!</p>

    <p>My favorite website is <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/">Pinterest</a>, because I can look at pictures of my favorite things and organize them into little boards.
