        <h2>A Favorite</h2>
        <p>Out of all the indian movies I have watched so far, my favorite one is a Bollywood movie called Don. It was released in 2006, and stars Shahrukh Khan, or SRK, as the titular character Don. The movie is a remake of the 1978 Don starring Amitabh Bachchan, but it has its own flair and personality. When I first saw the preview of it on Netflix during quarantine, I didn't expect I'd like it much, but I decided to try it anyway: and found out I was very wrong! Immediately after the first watch, I went to watch it again, because I <em>loved</em> the plot and characters. Don is what truly entangled me in the world of Indian movies, and I would recommend it to anyone who asks!</p>
